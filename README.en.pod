=head1 DESCRIPTION

This program picks up primary color of image file, particularly 
for nailart color on photo of fingers and nails.

The pcolpicker will proceed with several steps.
First, this will clop edges of memoried image data for the aim of
focusing to nails more (almostly nails are centered in picutres)
and redice data to calculate.

And then, the program convert image data from RGB set to HSV one
with reducing color depth.

And calculating and counting high chromatic colors pixcels with
excepting skin color.
(Skin color, about -5~15 degree of hue round and middle-to-low
chromatic will be excepted)

This program will output 6-digits hex number in default.
You can change this to decimal RGB numbers or stylesheet format
like C<#aabbcc> format with options. And also can get HSV data.
